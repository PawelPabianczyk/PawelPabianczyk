#### About me:
I am a student of Computer Science at Politechnika Krakowska. I have a great interest in mathematics and new technologies. I started my adventure with programming three years ago. My first program was in C++ where I learned the basics of algorithms, then I was passionate about C# and Java. Currently, I am developing my skills in backend technologies and databases.
