### Hi, I'm Pawel ðŸ‘‹
![background](/images/background_gh.jpg)

I am a student of Computer Science at Politechnika Krakowska. I started my adventure with programming at the university, which I went to due to the great interest in mathematics and new technologies. I first programmed in C++ to learn the basics of algorithms, then I have been learning C# (on my own) and Java to gain object oriented programming knowledge. Currently, I am interested in backend technologies and databases. 
If you want to see my latest projects, I recommend especially:
* [Vehicle-Rental-Backend (Java Spring)](https://github.com/PawelPabianczyk/Vehicle-Rental-Backend)
* [PrivateLibrary-client (Java, JavaFX)](https://github.com/PawelPabianczyk/PrivateLibrary-client)
* [PrivateLibrary-server (Java, Mysql)](https://github.com/PawelPabianczyk/PrivateLibrary-server)
* [PrivateLibrary-server-MongoDB (Java, MongoDB)](https://github.com/PawelPabianczyk/PrivateLibrary-server-MongoDB)
